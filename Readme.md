Go Generic Algorithms
=======================

Welcome friends! ðŸ‘‹ This repo is where I'll be attempting to capture some generic algorithms
written in Go!

Feel free to submit a PR and add any new algorithms if you fancy a challenge!

## BubbleSort Algorithm

You can attempt to run the bubblesort algorithm example using the following commands:

```bash
$ cd bubblesort
$ go1.18beta1 run bubblesort.go

## QuickSort Algorithm

You can attempt to run the quicksort algorithm example using the following commands:

```bash
$ cd quicksort
$ go1.18beta1 run quicksort.go
